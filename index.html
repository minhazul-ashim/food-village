                    <h1>Beef Steak</h1>
                    <p>A steak is a meat generally sliced across the muscle fibers, potentially including a bone. It is
                        normally grilled, though can also be pan-fried. It is often grilled in an attempt to replicate
                        the flavor of steak cooked over the glowing coals of an open fire.</p>

                        branches. Its leaves, leathery and lance-shaped, are dark green above and silvery on the
                        underside and are paired opposite each other on the twig. The wood is resistant to decay.</p>
